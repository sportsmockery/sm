DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS - CLAUDE-POWERED CHART TESTING
========================================================

You now have TWO autonomous Claude agents that will test your chart feature:

FILE 1: DATALABS_PostIQ_Chart_Tester.py
----------------------------------------
WHERE: Deploy to your Datalabs environment (backend)
WHAT: Tests PostIQ chart generation API
NEEDS:
  - Claude API key (from console.anthropic.com)
  - Your PostIQ API endpoint URL
  - Your PostIQ authentication token
  - Python packages: anthropic, requests

HOW TO RUN:
1. pip install anthropic requests
2. Edit configuration section (lines 271-273):
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "sk-ant-xxxxx"
   POSTIQ_ENDPOINT = "https://datalabs.sportsmockery.com/api/postiq"
   POSTIQ_API_KEY = "your-api-key"
3. python DATALABS_PostIQ_Chart_Tester.py
4. Results saved to: postiq_test_results_TIMESTAMP.json

FILE 2: FRONTEND_Chart_UI_Tester.py
------------------------------------
WHERE: Run locally or on CI pointing to test.sportsmockery.com
WHAT: Tests chart UI with browser automation
NEEDS:
  - Claude API key
  - Admin credentials for test.sportsmockery.com
  - Python packages: anthropic, playwright

HOW TO RUN:
1. pip install anthropic playwright
2. playwright install chromium
3. mkdir screenshots
4. Edit configuration section (lines 289-292):
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "sk-ant-xxxxx"
   BASE_URL = "https://test.sportsmockery.com"
   ADMIN_USERNAME = "your-username"
   ADMIN_PASSWORD = "your-password"
5. python FRONTEND_Chart_UI_Tester.py
6. Results saved to: frontend_test_results_TIMESTAMP.json
7. Screenshots saved to: screenshots/ directory

WHAT CLAUDE DOES:
-----------------
1. Runs comprehensive automated tests (8+ scenarios per system)
2. Captures failures, errors, performance metrics
3. Takes screenshots (frontend only)
4. Analyzes ALL results using Claude's reasoning
5. Provides:
   - Root cause analysis for failures
   - Performance assessment
   - UX/UI recommendations
   - Production readiness score
   - Prioritized fix list

OUTPUT FORMAT:
--------------
Both agents generate JSON reports you can send back to me:

{
  "test_run_id": "...",
  "total_tests": 15,
  "passed": 12,
  "failed": 3,
  "test_results": [...],
  "claude_analysis": {
    "root_causes": [...],
    "recommendations": [...],
    "production_ready": {"score": 75, "blockers": [...]}
  }
}

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
1. Deploy both Python scripts to appropriate environments
2. Configure API keys and credentials
3. Run both agents
4. Send me BOTH JSON reports
5. I'll provide consolidated analysis and optimization plan

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
- "ModuleNotFoundError": Run pip install commands
- "Login failed": Check admin credentials
- "API timeout": Check PostIQ endpoint URL
- "Selector not found": Your UI might use different element names
  → Send me screenshot and I'll update selectors
