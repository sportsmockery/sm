## Recommendations for Improvement

### High Priority (Would significantly improve user experience)
1. **Add fuzzy matching for player names** - Handle common misspellings
2. **Improve pronoun resolution** - Better NLP for "he/she/they/that team"
3. **Expand historical data** - Add pre-2019 seasons
4. **Add local college teams** - Northwestern, Illinois, Notre Dame

### Medium Priority (Would expand coverage)
5. **Add Chicago Fire FC** - MLS is growing in popularity
6. **Add Chicago Sky** - WNBA coverage
7. **Add game-by-game stats** - Most requested feature per QA testing
8. **Add betting-adjacent info** - Team records ATS (without recommendations)

### Low Priority (Nice to have)
9. **Add stadium/venue information** - Parking, transit, accessibility
10. **Add historical championship details** - 1985 Bears, 90s Bulls, etc.
